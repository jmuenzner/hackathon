#  NOTE: The request and reply contents are defined in ./protocol/protocol.proto

# request Create
request GetTree

## Declare pipes which apply to all storage and migration plans.
#  Pipes are analagous to middleware in a web server. Three types of pipes
#  are available:
#
#  cache:  intercept requests allowing implementation of any caching strategy
#  guard:  intercept requests to pre-emptively return errors for invalid
#          requests, or for backend resources (eg databases) being unavailable
#  report: hooks for custom reporting
#
#  Pipes here at the resource level will run before those defined at the storage
#  or migration level, otherwise pipes are run in the order they are defined.

# cache pipe Read via Cache.Get


## Declare a storage plan called "Legacy". It will be the default storage
#  plan for this resource. Only one storage plan may be the default, and a
#  default must be defined.

  ## Add a guard pipe to check the health of the database
  # guard pipe * via IsDatabaseHealthy
